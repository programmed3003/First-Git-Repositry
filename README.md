    <h1> Chapter 1 or Prologue, I am not sure</h1>
      <p>Every story has to start somewhere, right? Good or bad, it doesn't matter, we all have to start one. Some start earlier than others, some start much later than others. But how do we know whether a story is going to be bad or good? Just because we read a few lines which don't make sense or are boring, the story is bad?</p>
      <p>Everyone has there own taste in stories and it doesn't really matter whether you like mine or not, what matters is whether I like it or not. I am not writing for others, I am writing for myself. I am writing because its becoming harder to hold it in now. And the bubble has to pop sooner or later, every bubble does, even the big bang did.</p> 
      <p>My name is not important. What I do for a living is not important. What's important to me are my ideas, my sense of curiosity. Its because of these two things I am here in this place, in this moment of time, writing here. Why am I writing? Because I want to start my story now, and like I said, every story has to start at some point.</p>

				<p href="http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/310800-throughout-the-centuries-there-were-men-who-took-first-steps">"Throughout the centuries there were men who took first steps down new roads armed with nothing but their own vision. Their goals differed, but they all had this in common: that the step was first, the road new, the vision unborrowed, and the response they received — hatred. The great creators — the thinkers, the artists, the scientists, the inventors — stood alone against the men of their time. Every great new thought was opposed. Every great new invention was denounced. The first motor was considered foolish. The airplane was considered impossible. The power loom was considered vicious. Anesthesia was considered sinful. But the men of unborrowed vision went ahead. They fought, they suffered and they paid. But they won." - Ayn Rand, The Fountainhead</p>
